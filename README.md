# sklearn-regression-toolbox
Streamline your regression workflows with this versatile toolbox, packing data preprocessing, diverse model fitting, evaluation, and visualization capabilities. Equipped with linear, lasso, quadratic, neural network, and ensemble regression techniques.


Welcome to the Sklearn Regression Toolbox!

This repository acts as a comprehensive toolkit for tackling regression tasks in machine learning. Functions are designed to streamline your workflow, from data preparation to model fitting, evaluation, and visualization.


Key features:

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values effectively
Normalize or standardize features
Create meaningful interactions
Tailor data for optimal model performance


Regression Models:

Linear Regression (with cross-validation)
Lasso Regression (with cross-validation)
Quadratic Regression (with cross-validation)
Neural Networks (with cross-validation)
Ensemble Regression (combining multiple models for enhanced accuracy)


Evaluation and Visualization:

Assess model performance with essential metrics (e.g., R-squared, MSE, MAE)
Generate informative plots to visualize model predictions and residuals
Gain insights into model behavior and identify potential areas for improvement
